Title of the project ---> Hack-Hex (Wasserstoff Assignment)

Technology Stack ---> RectJs. However, I could have used vite, I just wanted to make it a little challenging. I started out in web development when people still had to create a react app with - "npx-create-react-app . ", So i thought of making this project this way.

Libraries used --->

Apexharts - I had used this in One of the Admin Dashboards i made last year, So it was fun using it again. https://takeabasket.netlify.app/

bootstrap - TailwindCSS has made life easy, This is the OG

react-router-dom - Routing made easy.

Recharts - Data visualisation is not a nightmare, Anymore.

Steps to run/build the project ----->

TO RUN THE PROJECT --->

cd "folder-name" npm install npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

TO BUILD THE PROJECT --->

cd "folder-name" npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

Approach --->

After going through the figma file. I broke project into a small components. So, Firstly I made Navbar, Secondly a sidebar after that I was not able to understand how to create a World map using code as it was mentioned in the Figma design- "You cannot use images", So I moved on with the project making the Overview section, Keeping aside the incomplete Hex-map part. I have used "react-router-dom" library for routing the various sections of the website. Charts were not a problem, I already had my fair share of troubles with charts, So it came around pretty easy. Every component i created, I made sure that it further broke down into components. So that it could be reused or updated without breaking the hierarchy of the website. For styling i have gone with simple CSS. Coming back to the most important part - Hex-Map . After spending the entire Saturday on d3-hexbin documentation. I was able to replicate USA but the entire world , Taking into consideration the deadline, I accepted defeat. I moved on with making the Dashboard Section and Footer, Thus wrapping my project.

If you have come this far --->

To be honest, I loved the thrill, the chaos and Everything in the middle. Thank you giving me this opportunity.

Eagerly waiting to hear from you.
